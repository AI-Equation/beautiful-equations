## Most Beautiful Equations and Formulas of All Time

## Introduction

We will introduce you some of the most beautiful equations or formulas of all time. These equations may take a very elegant and succint form, or indicate some fundamental relationships between different
factors,variables or materials. This list covers a wide range of subjects, such as math (algebra, geometry, calculus), physics, and so on. Some equations, for example most elementary school kids might be familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem. And some college student will finally know the relativity equations in College. You can visit DeepNLP Equation Search Engine (https://www.deepnlp.org/search/equation) and AI Agent Marketplace Search Engine (https://www.deepnlp.org/search/agent) to find the latex code, term explanation of related sources of most comprehensive equation databases and and articles. It covers a wide range of domains, ranging from STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) subjects to more quantiative subjects (Finance, Economics) in more advanced level. If you have your own equations that you would like to bookmark and share, you can also use the [Equation Latex Code Bookmark Workspace](http://www.deepnlp.org/workspace/detail) to Save your equations latex code and related explanations.
